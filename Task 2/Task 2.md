## Task 2 Implementing a UART loopback
### Step 1: Understanding the Verilog code
### UART Loopback Overview
**UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** is a hardware communication protocol used for serial communication between devices. It operates using two primary data lines:

- **TX (Transmit) pin** ‚Äì Sends data
- **RX (Receive) pin** ‚Äì Receives data

A UART loopback mechanism is a test mode where transmitted data (TX) is directly fed back into the receive line (RX) of the same module. This allows verification of UART functionality without requiring an external device.

### Analysis:

### üöÄ Module Breakdown
This module is designed to implement a UART loopback mechanism while also controlling an RGB LED based on the received data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Main Components
#### üü¢ Clock System

- Uses an Internal Oscillator (`SB_HFOSC`) to generate a clock signal.

- Configured with `CLKHF_DIV = "0b10"` to divide the frequency.

- Provides a timing reference for all operations.

#### üî¥ UART Loopback Communication

- TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) pins are directly connected within the module.

- Any data sent to `uarttx` is immediately received at `uartrx`.

- This feature is useful for self-testing UART functionality without needing another device.

#### üîµ Frequency Counter

- A 28-bit counter (`frequency_counter_i`) tracks oscillator cycles.

- It increases on each positive edge of the clock signal.

- Helps generate timing signals for internal operations.

#### üü° RGB LED Driver (SB_RGBA_DRV)

- Controls three LEDs: Red (`led_red`), Green (`led_green`), and Blue (`led_blue`).

- Uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to adjust brightness levels.

- UART data is directly mapped to LED brightness, allowing for visual feedback.

### üîÅ How It Works
#### ‚úÖ Receiving UART Data

- Data arrives at the `uartrx` pin.

- The same data is looped back to `uarttx` and sent out again.

- This confirms that UART transmission and reception are functioning correctly.

#### ‚úÖ LED Control Based on UART Data

- The received data is used to control the intensity of the RGB LEDs.

- PWM signals regulate LED brightness based on input values.

- All three LEDs change intensity together based on UART input.

#### ‚úÖ Clock & Timing Management

- The internal oscillator ensures stable timing.

- The frequency counter generates signals for PWM and UART operations.
